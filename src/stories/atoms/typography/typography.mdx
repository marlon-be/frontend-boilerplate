# Headings

Headings are styled by their HTML tag. Styling of a header can be overwritten by the usage of classes: `.h1`, `.h2`, etc...

## Note on CSS

The Typography CSS files includes all the basic variables for fonts, as well as `@font-face` declarations. These get added to the theme layer, but this way they are nicely grouped in one file
