import { IconGallery, IconItem, Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";


<Meta title="Molecules/Alert" />

# Alert
(Note that this is still a very basic alert with room to grow)

## Variable info
Sizes of Icons are exposed in the theme layer, this makes it handy for size calculations in components using icons:

## Usage

```
<Alert type="success" />
```

## Close button

In case an alert has a close button it can be the following:

```
<Alert type="success" hasClose />
```

The padding for the close button gets calculated based on the exposed icon width, find out more in the icons section.
