# Alert
(Note that this is still a very basic alert with room to grow)

## Variable info
Sizes of Icons are exposed in the theme layer, this makes it handy for size calculations in components using icons:

## Usage

```
<Alert variant="success" />
```

## Dismissible alert

An alert can become dismissible by adding the `dismissible` prop:

```
<Alert variant="success" dismissible />
```

The padding for the close button gets calculated based on the exposed icon width, find out more in the icons section.

## Variations

<Story of={AlertStories.Default} />
<Story of={AlertStories.Dismissable} />
<Story of={AlertStories.Success} />
<Story of={AlertStories.Warning} />
<Story of={AlertStories.Danger} />
