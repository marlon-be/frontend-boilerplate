# Breakout Grid

A breakout-grid is the ideal partner for fluid content pages with breakouts. This is based on a pattern by [Ryan Mulligan](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/layout-breakouts/) and there is a tool available for easy configuration at [Layout Breakouts Builder](https://layout-breakouts-builder.vercel.app/).

A nice convention is to prefix your tracks with `grid`.

## Basic usage

In the default styles there are 3 tracks:

- `.grid-full`
- `.grid-content` The default, max width equals container max width by exposed custom property `--container-max-width`.
- `.grid-popup`

The track widths can be found in the following variables:

```css
/** TRACK WIDTHS **/
--grid-full-max-width: 1fr;
--grid-popout-max-width: 1400px;
--grid-content-max-width: var(--container-max-width);
```

## Extended usage

It is possible to extend the usage by choosing a start and end point, for example:

```html
<div className="grid-popout-start grid-full-end">
	<strong>POPOUT TRACK START and FULL END</strong>
</div>
```

Each of the tracks has a `-start` and `-end` suffix to do just that, full classlist:

```css
.grid-full {
	grid-column: grid-full;
}
.grid-full-start {
	grid-column-start: grid-full-start;
}
.grid-full-end {
	grid-column-end: grid-full-end;
}

.grid-popout {
	grid-column: grid-popout;
}

.grid-popout-start {
	grid-column-start: grid-popout-start;
}

.grid-popout-end {
	grid-column-end: grid-popout-end;
}

.grid-content {
	grid-column: grid-content;
}

.grid-content-start {
	grid-column-start: grid-content-start;
}

.grid-content-end {
	grid-column-end: grid-content-end;
}

.full-width {
	grid-column: full;
}

.full-content,
.full-content-nopad {
	grid-column: full;
}

.full-content {
	padding-inline: var(--minimum-content-padding);
}
```

This is a real flexible system to build your web pages and for documentation's sake, I tried to keep it as true as possible tot the [Layout Breakouts Builder](https://layout-breakouts-builder.vercel.app/).
